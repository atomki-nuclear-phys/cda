This code is not of my own, but I like to use it for processing command
line arguments in applications. I copied the code from the ATLAS online
software myself, but am not sure where they got it from. (I'm pretty
sure they didn't write it either.)

As can be seen from the files, they are rather old. But I like to use
"good old" code... :-)
